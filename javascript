Javascript is dynamically typed language. dynamically means (pehle se nahi batana hota ki kis variable k under konsi value store hogi). You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc. 
For example: -  var a=40;     //holding number  
             var b="Rahul";  //holding string

  we can execute a js code in browser console as a temporary basis but mostly 
  major way to write js in code editor like (vs code it is free & very popular in 
  industry).it is one of the best.

Html is directly connected to browser.JS is directly connection with browser in the form of console.so we make indirect connection through html . like JS ïƒ html is already connect with browser 

*we use semicolon; in js that show a code is ended.without (;)semicolon also get a output but as a good coder we should use proper way to write code.
